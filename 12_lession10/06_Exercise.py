# Can you change the self-parameter inside a class to something else(say "omen").Try changing self to "slf" or "omen" and see the effects.

class Valorant:
    def __init__(omen):
        print("Object Created")

game1 = Valorant()

Yes, your code is correct â€” and it works because in Python, the self parameter is not a keyword, just a convention.(It's a standard to use)
